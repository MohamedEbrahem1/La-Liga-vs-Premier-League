# La-Liga-vs-Premier-League
League Excitement Analyzer
Customize Your Analysis and Uncover the Unexpected

This program lets you:
1. Choose the league you want to analyze from Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A.
2. Select the season of matches from.
3. Pick the betting website (Bet365, Betway, etc.)

You can then analyze and compare leagues to:
1. Find which teams have the highest home win, draw and away win odds on average
2. Uncover unexpected matches - those where the result differed from the betting odds or the half-time score
The data used comes from football-data.co.uk which contains football match stats and betting odds.

The program:
1. Imports necessary libraries
2. Prompts the user to select the league, season and betting website
3. Cleans the dataset
4. Calculates various betting odds by team
5. Plots graphs to visualize the results
6. Defines functions to calculate and plot unexpected matches using two methods:
    a. Based on the betting odds
    b. Based on changes after half-time

Future improvements include:
1. Adding more leagues and betting websites
2. Analyzing trends over multiple seasons
